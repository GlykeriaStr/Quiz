# Quiz

This is my first attempt at a Python project.  
There won't be any testing yet as I am still trying to learn how to do tests with user's input.

## To Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to the repo's directory `cd QUIZ`
3. Run `python app.py` in your terminal
4. Answer the 3 very difficult questions!
